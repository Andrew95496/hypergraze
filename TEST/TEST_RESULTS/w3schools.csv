Python Dates
A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module 
named datetime to work with dates as date 
objects.

Example
Import the datetime module and display the current date:

  import datetimex = datetime.datetime.now()print(x)

Date Output
When we execute the code from the example above the result will be:



The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date 
object.
Here are a few examples, you will learn more about them later in this 
chapter: 

Example
Return the year and name of weekday:

  import datetimex = datetime.datetime.now()print(x.year)
  print(x.strftime("%A"))

Creating Date Objects
To create a date, we can use the datetime() class (constructor) of the
datetime module.
The datetime() class requires three parameters to create a date: year, 
month, day.

Example
Create a date object:

  import datetimex = datetime.datetime(2020, 5, 17)
print(x)

The datetime() class also takes parameters for time and timezone (hour, 
minute, second, microsecond, tzone), but they are optional, and has a default 
value of 0, (None for timezone).







The strftime() Method
The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings.
The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter, 
format, to specify the format of the returned string:

Example
Display the name of the month:

  import datetimex = datetime.datetime(2018, 6, 1)print(x.strftime("%B"))
